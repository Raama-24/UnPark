🚗 UnPark
AI-Powered Smart Parking & Automated Violation Detection System

UnPark is an intelligent parking surveillance system that uses Computer Vision and AI to detect parking violations in real time, assign priority scores, and generate structured reports for enforcement authorities.It transforms passive CCTV monitoring into an automated, intelligent enforcement system.

📌 Problem

Illegal roadside and sidewalk parking is a common issue, especially in dense urban areas. It:
Blocks pedestrian walkways
Causes traffic bottlenecks
Requires inefficient manual monitoring


🚀 Features

✅ Real-time vehicle detection (YOLO)
✅ Multi-object tracking (DeepSORT / ByteTrack)
✅ Violation detection logic (No-parking / Overstay)
✅ Urgency scoring system
✅ OCR-based number plate extraction (ANPR-ready)
✅ Evidence clip generation
✅ MongoDB-based violation storage
✅ FastAPI backend
✅ Conceptual AR-assisted enforcement interface

🛠 Tech Stack

👨‍💻 Language : Python
🤖 AI & Computer Vision: YOLO (Ultralytics) , DeepSORT / ByteTrack , OpenCV , OCR (for ANPR pipeline)
🌐 Backend : FastAPI , REST APIs
🗄 Database: MongoDB (Atlas-ready)

⚙️ How It Works

1️⃣ Vehicle Detection
Vehicles are detected using YOLO with a confidence threshold:
Confidence≥τ
Only detections above threshold τ are processed further.

2️⃣ Violation Urgency Scoring
Each violation is assigned a priority score:
Urgency=αT+βL+γV

Where:
𝑇 = Duration of violation
L = Location severity weight
V = Vehicle type weight
α,β,γ = Tunable parameters

3️⃣ OCR & Reporting
Number plates are extracted using OCR
Violation metadata is stored in MongoDB
Evidence clips are saved
Structured reports can be generated for authorities
